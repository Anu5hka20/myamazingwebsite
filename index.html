							<p>Why are tropical rainforests going extinct? An average of 137 species of life forms are driven into extinction every day in the world's tropical rainforests. The forces of destruction such as logging, cattle ranching have all contributed to the loss of millions of acres of tropical rainforest. Animals and people alike lose their homes when trees are cut down.</p>

							<p>how much of our rainforests are going extinct? Pinning down exact numbers is nearly impossible, but most experts agree that we are losing upwards of 80,000 acres of tropical rainforest daily, and significantly degrading another 80,000 acres every day on top of that.</p>
							
							<blockquote>The most endangered rainforests are those in West Africa, where human populations are doubling every 20 years, and in Central America and South-East Asia. Although large areas of rainforest remain in Central Africa and South America, they, too, are disappearing at an alarming rate.</blockquote>
							

							<p>Another important thing to note is that rainforests are perhaps the most endangered habitat on earth and most vulnerable to deforestation. Each year, some 140,000 sq km of rainforests are destroyed. Rainforests are being felled for timber by logging companies and cleared by people for farming.</p>

								<h2>Are tropical rainforests able to grow back?</h2>
							</a>
							
							<img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="assets/img/post002-image001.jpg" alt="Champion">

							<p>Study suggests tropical forests can regenerate naturally — if we let them. A study carried out by scientists in 18 countries found tropical forests to be more resilient than once believed and largely capable of regenerating over just a few decades.</p>

							<h3>Do humans actually have to help in order for rainforests to grow back?</h3>

							<p>An international group of researchers looking at a number of aspects of tropical forests has found that the potential for regrowth is substantial if they are left untouched by humans for about 20 years. For example, soil takes an average of 10 years to recover its previous status, plant community and animal biodiversity take 60 years, and overall biomass takes a total of 120, according to their calculations.” This is due in part to a multidimensional mechanism whereby old forest flora and fauna help a new generation of forest grow – a natural process known as “secondary succession”.</p>

								<h2>Just how important are rainforests to us humans?</h2>

							<p>Rainforests are often called the lungs of the planet for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and increasing local humidity. Rainforests also stabilize climate, house incredible amounts of plants and wildlife, and produce nourishing rainfall all around the planet.</p>

							<p>As well as the vivid beauty that comes with great diversity in plants and animals, rainforests also play a practical role in keeping our planet healthy. By absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing the oxygen that we depend on for our survival. The absorption of this CO2 also helps to stabilize the Earth's climate. 
							Rainforests also help to maintain the world's water cycle by adding water to the atmosphere through the process of transpiration which creates clouds. Water generated in rainforests travel around the world; scientists think that moisture generated in the forests of Africa ends up falling as rain in the Americas!</p>
